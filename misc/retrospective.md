We started good and got everyone a feature to work on.

Amir had a great experience with his feature and could update template from the database table.
Also created the asset table where we talked a bought the structure and had to do 2. version until we had the asset table at our disposal.
He was able to validate the radio boxes and realize in the end that we don't need to validate the radio and checkboxes.
So he also validates the index page to put in a category before you start a quiz.
What also was interesting were Amir Team up with Sam to make sure that not more than 2 boxes can get clicked when having multiple choices.

Sam when it comes to function, the question of single choice calculation was quite easy to achieve.
What was challenging was the multiple choice function. 
Thanks to some experience with database, the fetch option was more the part where I created option.
It was challenging to try to get the answer from 2 table, but it worked out, and I could use the pretty print function to see if it works.
The 2 table was challenging to handle and also to invert my multiple choice question in the category history.
Generally project Management was nice


Jules The Mobile UI and make the page fit on screen was very challenging. I'm sure there are more improvement and a better work flow to reach when it comes to set this up. I really enjoy the team to have us all explained what we did and how our page is functioning.
We try to make every one's vision come up to one vision, what was fun to.

Mike Trello was something I'm used to organizing. The animation was fun to get and development my knowledge.
To be included in all aspect of the project I really enjoy. The Figma is something i more and more be able to say I can work with it and also add interaction for a good impression to represent the page on all devices.
